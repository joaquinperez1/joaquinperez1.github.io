<p class="descripccion">
 "Los Sueños Acidos del Apocalipsis" (Acid Dreams of the Apocalypse) is a collection of electronic psychedelic tracks I made this year while living in isolation, sleeping during the day and making music at night fueled by mixed berry smoothies and mushroom microdoses.

 <br> I was inspired by psychedelic music, retro sci-fi and surrealist art and diverse artists such as Alice Coltrane, Dora Jar, Legowelt, J Dilla, Tame Impala.
<br>
 This is the first EP I release under Copperz but it's not the first one I made, I was supposed to release other two albums this year but times changed and I decided to release this independently as a way to capture and share the sublime and melancholic vibrations that I felt this year, which to me and many people felt like the beginning of the apocalypse.
